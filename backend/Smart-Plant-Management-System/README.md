# üå± Smart Plant Management System

## üìå Project Description
The **Smart Plant Management System** is an IoT and AI-powered platform designed to help gardeners and farmers monitor plant health.  
It integrates **ESP32 sensors and camera**, a **Spring Boot backend**, and a **Python machine learning model** for disease detection.  
The system also uses **Ollama AI** to generate natural language insights and provides a **community learning forum** for knowledge sharing.

**Key Features:**
- User registration and login (Gardener / Expert roles)
- Plant registration with image recognition (Plant.ID API) and location mapping
- Real-time monitoring of weather and IoT sensor data (ESP32-CAM, DHT22, soil moisture sensor)
- Inline disease detection from IoT camera images
- Standalone diagnosis page for direct image upload and AI insights
- AI Assistant for plant-related queries
- Learning forum with posts, comments, upvotes, and downvotes
- Expert and Analytics pages (under development)
